Day 1 :

Today I learned about Linked List and its 3 types. Also learned about what is Node and insertion operation of nodes in the linked list at various positions.

case 1 : 
Insertion at Starting Position ( Pos = 0)

case 2 : 
Insertion at Ending Position ( Pos = Size - 1)

Case 3:
Insertion at given Position 

Validation to be checked : 
1. Is LinkedList Empty?
2. Is given postion valid?
